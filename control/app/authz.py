"""What an authenticated caller may ask for, decided in one place.

gate.py answers "who is this"; this module answers "may they". Kept free of FastAPI so the
rules can be tested as a table.

* The administrator may do anything, so a new management route needs no entry here.
* The engine may deliver its callback and nothing else.
* A client app (clients.py) may use a line's communication features -- texts, MMS, calls,
  voicemail, the softphone relay, and a read-only view of the line -- and nothing else. The list
  is an allow-list: a route added later is refused to clients until somebody decides a client
  needs it, and the pull request that adds such a route adds its row here.
* Anything else is refused.

Events on the live WebSocket follow the same idea (``event_for``): a client hears about its
lines' conversations and calls, not about the host. A line's status is cut to what a client
needs wherever it appears -- the status route, the line list and the status event
(``status_for``).
