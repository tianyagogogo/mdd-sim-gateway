"""Address-book formats and number matching, without a database in sight.

Two things here are easy to get wrong and worth stating.

**Matching.** A number arrives in whatever shape the network used: `+447700900123` from one
carrier, `07700900123` from another, `00447700900123` over a third. An address book entered by
hand is no tidier. Two spellings are compared by reducing each to E.164, which is the only form
that names one destination from anywhere.

Reducing a national spelling to E.164 needs to know which country it is national to, and the
answer is the line's: a number arriving on a line is written the way that SIM's home network
writes it. So a number typed in national form is keyed once for each country the gateway has a
line in (`number_keys`), and an arriving number is compared only against the key for the
country of the line it arrived on. That is what a phone holding that SIM and this address book
would do. Callers pass the arriving line's country as `region`, and the gateway's countries as
`regions`.

Comparing trailing digits instead, as handsets do, is tempting and wrong here. It has to take
the tail of the full international digit string, so as soon as the subscriber number is short
enough the country code is inside the window: `+86 20 10000` and `020 10000` then differ, while
`+86 20 10000` and `+44 20 6201 0000` collide and one caller is announced under the other's
name. Short national numbers of exactly this shape are ordinary in several numbering plans.

A number that is only meaningful where it was dialled -- a short code, or a subscriber number
with the area code left off -- is deliberately **not** reconciled with a fuller spelling. Local
`10000`, `020 10000` and `010 10000` may be three different destinations, and the gateway has
no way to know which one was meant: its SIMs carry a country, never an area code. Such a number
is kept as its digits and is equal only to the same digits.

**Import.** A vCard from a phone can be exported by anything, so the parser stays conservative:
it reads the properties that carry a name and numbers, understands the folding and escaping the
format requires, and ignores what it does not know rather than guessing. A row that cannot be
read is reported by name, never dropped silently -- somebody importing three hundred contacts
needs to know which two did not arrive.
