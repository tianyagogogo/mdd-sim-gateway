"""Who is calling the control surface, answered once for HTTP and WebSocket alike.

Every management route lives under ``/api/`` and every WebSocket needs a signed-in browser, so
one ASGI middleware sits in front of both. It used to be an HTTP middleware, which never sees a
WebSocket handshake: each socket endpoint had to repeat the session check itself, and a socket
added later without that check would have been open to anyone.

The middleware resolves the caller to a :class:`Principal`, refuses what needs a credential
the caller does not have, and leaves the answer in ``scope["state"]["principal"]`` for handlers
that need to know more than "allowed".

A socket authenticated by the session cookie must also come from the gateway's own page. The
cookie is SameSite=Strict, but "site" means the registrable domain: a page on a sibling host
(``other.example.net`` beside ``gateway.example.net``) still gets the cookie attached. Browsers
always send ``Origin`` on a WebSocket handshake and a page cannot change it, so the handshake is
accepted only when that origin is the host the browser asked for.

A client app (clients.py) presents ``Authorization: Bearer`` instead. A request that carries
that header is judged by the token alone -- the cookie is ignored -- so it needs no CSRF token
(nothing attaches a bearer token by itself) and no origin (it is not a page), and the cookie's
own CSRF and origin checks are untouched by it.

Once the caller is known, authz.allowed decides whether they may make this request. Revoking a
credential also closes the WebSockets opened with it (``revoke``), so a signed-out browser or a
thrown-off phone stops receiving events at once rather than at its next reconnect.
