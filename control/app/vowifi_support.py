"""Whether a SIM's carrier offers VoWiFi at all, before a line spends retries finding out.

Phones do not probe for this either. An iPhone shows the Wi-Fi Calling switch only when the
carrier bundle enables it, and Android reads `carrier_wfc_ims_available_bool` from its
carrier config. Here the same decision comes from two sources:

1. A small table of carriers known not to offer Wi-Fi Calling to ordinary subscribers.
2. The carrier's standard ePDG name. When public DNS answers "no such name", the carrier
   publishes no ePDG, so a tunnel cannot be built from the open internet.

"supported" only ever means worth trying: plan, IMEI allow-lists and country rules can still
refuse a line. "unsupported" is a strong statement, but the user can always try anyway.
