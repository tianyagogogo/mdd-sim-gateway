# (IMS registration + voice/SMS).
#
# SWu tunnel: swu_ike.py (fasferraz/SWu-IKEv2, patched) is the sole ePDG tunnel path. It does
# IKEv2 + EAP-AKA (verifying the SIM PIN in its own PC/SC connection), userspace ESP over a
# tun device named "ipsec0" (so pjsip's bind_interface is unchanged), assigns the IPv6 inner
# address, and requests the IPv6 P-CSCF. A supervisor restarts it on exit; because every fresh
# start re-runs EAP-AKA WITH the PIN verify, the tunnel self-heals after a rekey/reauth teardown.
#
# PC/SC: this container is a pcscd CLIENT — it talks to the HOST pcscd via the bind-mounted
# /run/pcscd socket. The pcsc-lite client library is pinned to the same version as the host
# pcscd (see Dockerfile PCSC_VERSION) so the client/server protocol always matches.
